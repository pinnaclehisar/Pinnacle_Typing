On Saturday, the GST Council approved final drafts of the Central and Integrated GST Bills, which should be placed in the public domain as soon as possible. With the law to compensate States already cleared, the only pending legislative negotiation left for the Council, which is expected to meet again on March 16, involves the State and Union Territories' GST bills. As these bills secure assent from State Assemblies and Parliament, and swiftly, the operational rules for the GST must be readied. Industry would need at least three months after that to prepare for the transition from the present system of myriad State, Central and local levies on goods and services. Moreover, switching to a new indirect tax system in the middle of a financial year will bring its own subset of accounting complications. The Central government should resist a pushback on the roll-out date, and expedite efforts to ensure everyone is ready to get on board the new system with early clarity on what rates would apply to different goods and services. 
Clearer communication of intent is equally essential. In industry circles, the introduction of a peak 40% tax rate in the GST Bills has set the cat among the pigeons. What started out as a single tax, single market dream for industry has now degenerated into five tax rates, a cess on top, with additional uncertainty about tax rates. Just as effective excise and customs duties are lower than legally specified rates, working in a peak rate for the GST could well be justified. In the current rate structure, a cess has been proposed on luxury and sin goods over and above the highest GST rate of 28%. The cess would finance compensation payouts to States for the first five years.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T102<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Manipur will vote in 38 of its 60 Assembly constituencies on Saturday in the first of two phases. This election is shaping up into something new for Manipur's polity, a direct contest between two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Congress is seeking to defend its 15-year record in power, while the BJP fancies its chances in a State that has generally voted favourably for the party ruling at the Centre. The four-month-long blockade by the United Naga Council of highways leading up to the valley has dominated the discourse in the run-up to the elections. The Manipur elections are important for both national parties. The Congress is seeking to retain its hold as the only party that has electoral support across various ethnic and geographic regions in the State, while the BJP is keen to get power in another northeastern State, after its victory last year in Assam. A contest between the Congress and the BJP in Manipur is welcome, as both parties do not represent any specific ethnic groups, unlike other parties in the fray in previous elections. But the BJP lacks a grassroots base in Manipur and largely comprises leaders who have defected from the Congress. This has resulted in a political campaign largely made up of accusations and counter-accusations of corruption, besides the blame game on the ongoing blockade.
The decision in early December 2016 by the Okram Ibobi Singh government to notify the formation of seven new districts, creating 16 districts in the State, was momentous. It allowed the Congress to seek support from the hill areas for this decision. However, it resulted in the intensification of the blockade sponsored by the UNC, severely hitting normal life in Manipur. The persistence of the blockade has led to some degree of disaffection owing to the inability of the Congress government to bring it to an end, even if the government's defence that any punitive measures against the UNC would have led to violence cannot be summarily dismissed.

In Afghanistan, where both China and India see potential for investment and share concerns over the rise of radicalism and terrorism, there are many avenues for cooperation. The fact that Beijing initiated the special talks by inviting Indian officials who deal with Afghanistan and proposed a "joint development project" encourages the conclusion that China is unwilling to have its options cramped by Pakistan's reservations about India's role in Afghanistan. The Ministry of External Affairs says there was broad agreement on trade and economic ties, with Chinese officials reportedly praising India's measures to welcome investment and facilitate visas for closer business ties. On the issues that dominated the India-China narrative in 2016, particularly India's bid for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership and to have Masood Azhar designated a global terrorist at the UN, there was little movement. But a new conversation has started, and could yield results by the mid-year deadline.
There is a lowering of rhetoric as well. While China is no longer trotting out its old line on opposing India's NSG membership as a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, India has stopped referring to China as the "one country" that is thwarting its ambitions. New Delhi must prepare for the larger challenge this year that will inevitably come from China's Belt and Road Initiative (B&amp;RI, or One Belt, One Road). Through the mega infrastructure and trade project, China has plans in place to reach out to each one of India's land and maritime neighbours, most of whom have signed up for it. In May, a conference hosted by President Xi Jinping will bring all of India's neighbourhood to Beijing, with the exception of India. India has decided to not join the B&amp;RI.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T104<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The protests that have convulsed Romania are the largest since the fall of communism in the country in 1989. Hundreds of thousands of Romanians have taken to the streets against the government's attempt to decriminalise graft involving sums below a certain threshold, ostensibly for practical reasons. The move has impressed neither the citizens of Romania, nor European Union officials in Brussels. Even the country's President has thrown his weight behind the protests. The popular outcry against such a blatant move to relax the rules should have been anticipated by the government, especially as it had a direct bearing on the Social Democratic Party (PSD), which heads the current coalition. Its leader could not assume charge as Prime Minister only because an existing law bars convicted politicians from occupying the office. Similarly, judicial proceedings currently involving a number of elected representatives and officials are a measure of the independent functioning of the body in charge of fighting graft. It has been argued in some quarters that the agency has been overzealous in its endeavour to combat corruption. Either way, by venturing to ease the extent of the penalties, the ruling coalition has run the risk of being perceived as trying to protect the guilty.
Faced with popular anger, the government has rescinded the decree to let off offenders in cases where the financial harm is less than about $48,000. But it is still insistent on pursuing its controversial objective to pardon errant officials through the normal parliamentary route, citing in its defence the overcrowding of prisons. When Romania joined the EU in 2007, the precondition of membership - strict enforcement of the rule of law - sat uneasily with the realities on the ground. The country ranked high on the graft and crime index, besides attracting criticism for the treatment of its sizeable Roma minorities. Many of these concerns still remain. But they are being addressed systematically through the adoption of an institutional framework.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T105<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Personal angst, public interest, and a sharp eye for a political opportunity have combined in different measures to prompt Tamil Nadu Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam to do what he himself may have regarded as unthinkable: revolt against the AIADMK leadership. A die-hard loyalist of Jayalalithaa, and by extension of his one-time benefactor Ms. Sasikala, Mr. Panneerselvam, who was perceived as the archetypal feudal supplicant, chose his moment to strike back at the patricians in the party. After years of bowing before Jayalalithaa, and doing as he was told unquestioningly, the three-time stand-in Chief Minister wanted, entirely legitimately, more leeway under Ms. Sasikala. Clearly, he realised after Jayalalithaa's death, that he would have to put up with another round of slavish obeisance. But it was when he sensed the public mood turning against Ms. Sasikala that he found the courage and the strength to protest. In invoking Jayalalithaa's name to justify his revolt, Mr. Panneerselvam is trying to project that it is he who is her chosen political heir. It is difficult to say how successful he will be in inheriting this mantle, but the political damage he has done to Ms. Sasikala is considerable. Not many AIADMK MLAs may have joined his revolt, but it has touched a chord with the rank and file, something she will have to contend with. On the defensive as she awaits a Supreme Court judgment in the disproportionate assets case, the long-standing friend of Jayalalithaa appears vulnerable both legally and politically. Clearly, the cloak of invincibility that Jayalalithaa seemed to have on her during even the most testing times was not Ms. Sasikala's to wear.
What Mr. Panneerselvam demonstrated to the AIADMK cadre was that there was nothing to recommend Ms. Sasikala other than her proximity to Jayalalithaa; in this she was only marginally better placed than Deepa Jayakumar, Jayalalithaa's niece, who is also making a bid to inherit the political legacy without ever having any kind of association with politics.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T106<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>India's most populous State finally goes to the polls today, beginning a seven-phase process that starts from the western fringe of Uttar Pradesh. In this first phase, 73 Assembly constituencies in 15 districts of western Uttar Pradesh will elect their legislators in what is clearly the most diversely contested region of the State, the only one in which all four parties/fronts, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Samajwadi Party-Congress, the Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal, fancy their chances. That they all see themselves to be firmly in the hunt indicates the change in western U.P. since the 2014 general election when the BJP registered its biggest margins of leads in Assembly segments. Then, riots in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts in 2013 had resulted in communal polarisation in the BJP's favour, supplementing the Narendra Modi wave in the State: the BJP alliance netted 73 of the total 80 Lok Sabha seats. But two years is a long time in politics, and issues such as the demonetisation, the performance of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, and BSP leader Mayawati's reliance on a new samikaran (caste-religion arithmetic) have all changed the nature of the campaign.
This time, reports suggest that many in the landed peasantry among Jats are looking again at the RLD, which till not long ago had been staring at a political decline, as a viable choice. Despite a relatively favourable monsoon and a better agrarian harvest, farmers are now less well-disposed towards the BJP following the demonetisation. The BSP has struck a chord with its traditional support base among Dalits and has fielded a large number of Muslim candidates to consolidate support among the minorities. The SP-Congress alliance seeks to ride a wave of positive support for Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav after his combat with party elders. The BJP has its task cut out to retain its support here, with the effects of the demonetisation hurting traders too. But Mr. Modi's appeal is still strong, especially among the younger voters.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T107<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The quest to find life outside the solar system got a big boost with the discovery of seven Earth-size extra-solar planets, or exoplanets, orbiting a dwarf star about 40 light years away. Unlike earlier discoveries of exoplanets, all seven planets could possibly have liquid water - a key to life as we know it on Earth - with three planets having the greatest chance. This is by far the largest collection of Earth-like planets in the habitable 'Goldilocks' zone of a star - neither too close nor too far from a star, which raises the possibility of liquid water being present on the surface. Only Earth has liquid water in the solar system. Less than a year after scientists announced the discovery of three planets orbiting the dwarf star, the team found four more through intense searches using several ground-based telescopes, including a 20-day continuous monitoring using the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Spitzer Space Telescope. Since the dwarf star is much cooler than the Sun, the dimming of light each time a planet passes or transits before the star could be easily recorded from Earth unlike in cases when planets transit a Sun-like bright star. Since the initial discovery of three planets was made using the Chile-based Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope, the exoplanet system is called TRAPPIST-1. Unlike in the case of our solar system, the planets have apparently formed far away from the star and gradually migrated towards it; they share a similar formation history with the Galilean moons, which migrated towards Jupiter after formation. Another major difference in comparison with the solar system is the tight packing of the seven planets around the star. The closest planet in the TRAPPIST-1 system takes just 1.5 days to complete an orbit and the farthest one takes 20 days; the orbital period of the planets is also similar to the Galilean moons.
A very uneasy calm was restored to the Delhi University's North campus by Thursday, with anxiety still gripping colleges and hostels after two days of violence. Trouble started on Tuesday when members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student organisation linked to the BJP.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T108<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>With a fair possibility of liquid water being present on at least three planets, the focus is now on deciphering the climate and chemical composition of their atmosphere. As a first measure, scientists are keen to know if the planets are Earth-like, by ruling out the presence of hydrogen gas enveloping them. Mass estimates already suggest that the inner six planets might have a rocky composition, while the one with a low density may have a volatile composition due to the presence of an ice layer or atmosphere. The composition of the atmosphere can be identified by measuring the wavelength characteristics of light. Since the TRAPPIST-1 system is close by and the star is cool enough, it would be easier to decipher the various critical features of the planets. If there is life on these planets, we would know this in about 10 years. The search for extraterrestrial life has just become more focussed.
Umar Khalid was to have spoken in a session on "Unveiling the state: Regions in conflict - the war in Adivasi areas", reportedly based on his research on Bastar. It was part of a programme cleared by the college authorities. If they are so quickly intimidated into cancelling the seminar, if the police do not rally sufficiently to protect debate on the campus, the signal goes out that students and faculty are on their own in defending the right to free debate. The Ramjas College incident also comes a year after the events at JNU when the ABVP led the Sangh's charge against what they deemed to be "anti-national". Then too an impression was created that the police were too easily led to heed the ABVP's agenda; the reverberations of that episode are still being felt. Universities are arenas for intellectual evolution, they are meant to be spaces where discussion and debate push boundaries, where students learn not only the art of provocation but also the argumentative skills to defend and oppose such provocation. Certainly, there are necessary curbs such as a bar on speech that incites violence and hate. But when a student's organisation uses violence to have a seminar cancelled, and when the authorities succumb so easily, Indian academia stands diminished.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T109<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Going against the status quo to take a progressive decision is always a difficult endeavour in politics or in government. Such decisions yield enthusiastic support from those in favour of change; at the same time, they invite strong responses from reactionary sections. The right thing to do for any politician seeking to embark on change is to not give in to resistance after making the decision. T.R. Zeliang, who recently stepped down as the Chief Minister of Nagaland, had taken the bold decision to conduct long-pending urban local body elections on February 1 with 33% reservation for women in accordance with the 74th Amendment to the Constitution. The move, predictably, resulted in strong opposition from tribal groups who sought to use the issue of Naga autonomy as a ploy to resist it. Mr. Zeliang should have stuck to his government's order and sought more public acceptance by rallying the many in favour - in particular, Naga women who would have finally got their constitutionally mandated stake in local governance. Instead, he chose to take a U-turn and termed the implementation of the decision as "null and void", emboldening tribal organisations to demand his resignation. Following a series of agitations by two tribal groups, the Joint Coordination Committee and the Nagaland Tribes Action Committee, Mr. Zeliang finally resigned, but not before some drama was played out in the ruling Naga People's Front.
It was clear that Mr. Zeliang was being pressured to resign not just by status quoists among tribal groups but also by his rivals in the NPF. Some legislators were seeking the return of the former Chief Minister and MP, Neiphiu Rio, who had been suspended from the party last year on grounds of "anti-party activities". Immediately, in what is now becoming a routine act in Indian politics following any intra-ruling party intrigue, the legislators were taken to a resort in Kaziranga and confined there to prevent defections. Fearing a split, Mr. Zeliang resigned, and the party's senior leader and supremo Shurhozelie Liezietsu was nominated as the 11th Chief Minister of the State by 42 of the 49 NPF legislators.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T110<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>While India's celebrated demographic dividend has for decades underpinned its rapid economic progress, a countervailing force may offset some of the gains from having a relatively young population: rapid ageing at the top end of the scale. This is a cause of deep concern for policymakers as India already has the world's second largest population of the elderly, defined as those above 60 years of age. As this 104-million-strong cohort continues to expand at an accelerating pace, it will generate enormous socio-economic pressures as the demand for healthcare services and tailored accommodation spikes to historically unprecedented levels. It is projected that approximately 20% of Indians will be elderly by 2050, marking a dramatic jump from the current 8%. However, thus far, efforts to develop a regime of health and social care that is attuned to the shifting needs of the population have been insufficient. While more mature economies have created multiple models for elder care, such as universal or widely accessible health insurance, networks of nursing homes, and palliative care specialisations, it is hard to find such systemic developments in India. Experts also caution that as the proportional size of the elderly population expands, there is likely to be a shift in the disease patterns from communicable to non-communicable, which itself calls for re-gearing the health-care system toward "preventive, promotive, curative and rehabilitative aspects of health".
Advocacy and information campaigns may be necessary to redirect social attitudes toward ageing, which often do not help the elderly enjoy a life of stability and dignity. As highlighted in 'Uncertain Twilight', a four-part series in The Hindu on the welfare of senior citizens, the ground realities faced by the elderly include abandonment by their families, destitution and homelessness, inability to access quality health care, low levels of institutional support, and the loneliness and depression associated with separation from their families. On the one hand, the traditional arrangements for the elderly in an Indian family revolve around care provided by their children.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T111<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Capping the prices of medical stents, which are used to treat coronary artery disease, by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) is an extreme regulatory measure necessitated by the market failure that afflicts the overall delivery of health care in India. Rising costs have led to impoverishment of families and litigation demanding regulation. Given the overall dominance of private, commercial, for-profit health institutions, and the asymmetry confronting citizens, correctives to bring about a balance are inevitable. Two important pointers to the need for cost regulation are available from research published in The Lancet in December 2015: nearly two-thirds of the high out-of-pocket expenditure on health incurred by Indians went towards drugs; even the meagre research data available showed that there was irrational use of medical technologies, including cardiac stents and knee implants. Regulated prices can, therefore, be expected to make stents more accessible to patients who really need them, helping them avoid using up the weak insurance cover available, while also reducing the incentive for unethical hospitals to use them needlessly. It is worth recalling that there are over 60 million diagnosed diabetics in the country, and the average age at which the first heart attack strikes Indians is 50, a decade earlier than people in developed nations. At appropriate prices, and with a health system that pools the cost among all citizens, it would be possible to provide access to stents and other treatments for all.
Health-care providers often demand market-determined pricing of medical technologies on the ground that newer ones will not be available under a regulated regime. In the case of cardiac stents, this argument does not hold water since stakeholder consultations held by the NPPA in January revealed that there are 'huge unethical markups' in the supply chain. It was estimated five years ago by the Planning Commission’s expert group on universal health coverage that raising spending on public procurement of medicines to 0.5% of GDP (from 0.1%) would provide all essential medicines to everyone.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T112<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>In Chandogya Upanishad, Uddalaka explains to his son Svetaketu, that Brahman is the cause for tejas, water and food. He then explains that all sentient beings too have Brahman as their cause. When a jivatma is in the state of deep sleep (sushupti), he is free of all the defects of nama, roopa, raga, dwesha and all other limiting factors. He loses dharmabhuta jnana (attributive consciousness) and is free from identities such as manushya, deva and so on, explained M.K. Srinivasan, in a discourse. In short, the jivatma is shorn of identity and also of all limitations he is subject to in the waking state. The jivatma unites with the Paramatma in the state of sushupti. In the state of sushupti, the mind flies in all directions, but finds no resting place, and finally settles in mukhyaprana or vital airs. An analogy is used in the Chandogya Upanishad to explain this. If a bird is tied with a string, that is held by a hunter and the bird attempts to fly in different directions, it cannot find a resting place other than the hunter hand. Likewise is the mind tied to prana. During deep sleep, the mind and indriyas cease to function and attain union with prana. The prana unites with jiva united with subtle elements, and they unite with Paramatma. So this is a special kind of union, and does not signify merger of jivatma into Paramatma. They do not attain oneness. They remain differentiated.
What the Upanishad means is that all jivatmas constitute the body of Brahman, which is the root cause of the Universe. To substantiate this, the Upanishad then states everything in reverse order too. The cause of the body is food, the cause of which is water, the cause of which is tejas, the cause of which is Brahman. Thus Brahman is the originating point for everything. Arjuna observed penance to obtain the Pasupatastra from Lord Siva. Pleased with his penance, Lord Siva wanted to reward him with the weapon, said V.S. Karunakarachariar in a discourse. But Goddess Parvati laid down a condition. She said that Arjuna had never turned away from a battle. So She said that Siva should draw Arjuna into a fight, so that he would turn away and She would be witness to this. In the meanwhile, Duryodhana had sought the help of a demon to disturb Arjuna penance. This demon took the form of a porcupine and went to attack Arjuna. Siva and Parvati, in the guise of a hunter and his wife, arrived just as this attack began.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T113<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The horrific suicide attack at a Sufi shrine in Sehwan in Pakistan's Sindh province that killed at least 80 people, underscores fears about the Islamic State gaining strength in the country. A suicide bomber blew himself up at the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, among the most venerated of Sufi saints. People of all faiths in the subcontinent have flocked here over the centuries, making it a prominent symbol of syncretism, and thereby a particularly potent target for the IS. The terrorist group, which had announced its Pakistan branch more than two years ago, has claimed a string of attacks in recent months, mostly on minority Muslim sects. Initially, Pakistani authorities had denied that the IS has any organisational presence in the country. However, attacks such as this, which the IS promptly took responsibility for, suggest otherwise. In Iraq and Syria the IS has methodically targeted Shias, Alawis, Kurds and Yazidis. In Pakistan and Afghanistan, Shias, Hazaras and Sufis are being attacked. Pakistan, particularly, has a rich Sufi tradition, a mystical and generally moderate form of Islam that is loathed by fundamentalists. In 2010, Lahore's Data Darbar shrine had been brutally attacked. In June last year, the popular Sufi singer, Amjad Sabri, was shot dead in Karachi. Three months ago, a Sufi shrine in Balochistan was bombed by the IS, killing 45 people. The attack at the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar came when it was full of devotees, to cause maximum harm.
The IS is clearly following a strategy that was successful in mobilising fighters and gaining publicity in Iraq and Syria. The highly planned, well-publicised attacks on Shias in these countries helped the IS whip up Sunni sectarian sentiment and win recruits. There is still no evidence that the Pakistani branch of the group is directed by the IS core in Mosul or Raqqah. But IS fighters in eastern Afghanistan, where the group has established a province of the 'Caliphate', and those in Pakistan seem to have aligned themselves with local terror groups for organisational support. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a ferociously anti-Shia group, and Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a breakaway faction of the Pakistani Taliban, are two such groups that reportedly have a tactical alliance with the IS. Most of the major recent suicide attacks in Pakistan were carried out by these three groups.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T114<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Celebrated rivalries in cricket revolve, in the popular mind, around the Ashes or contests involving India and Pakistan. Both duels have the weight of history and are replete with anecdotes. But as Steve Smith's men play and train under the Mumbai sun in their build-up to the four-match Test series at Pune, Bengaluru, Ranchi and Dharamsala, it is time to acknowledge the particular intensity that marks games involving India and Australia. It is a rivalry inferior to none, the folklore further amplified by riveting contests, especially in India. Be it at Kolkata's Eden Gardens in 2001 when V.V.S. Laxman's 281 helped India stage one of cricket’s most remarkable fight-backs, or at Chennai's Chepauk back in 1986, when India and Australia played out only the second tie in cricketing history since 1877, the contests have ticked all the boxes: mighty individual performances, oscillating fortunes and a fifth-day cracker. When rival skippers Virat Kohli and Smith walk out for the toss at Pune's Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium on February 23, they will take this legacy forward. Helmed by young men - Kohli is 28, Smith 27 - both the Indian and Australian teams are emerging from the struggles of transition; this series is their big chance at asserting greatness.
India at home is a daunting opposition, the 'Final Frontier' for Australia as Steve Waugh called it. The home team is in fine form, with emphatic victories against visiting teams over the last year, South Africa, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. In its last 19 Tests, both home and away, India has remained undefeated, winning 15 of them. It is a validation of the squad's evolution underpinned by the consistency of its two leading players, Kohli and off-spinner R. Ashwin, and augmented with others rising to the opportunity when it's come - as Karun Nair did with his unbeaten 303 in the Chennai Test against England last December. A resolute captain and a calm coach, in Anil Kumble, have astutely guided the team. The odds favour India, and so does history. When Australia last toured India in 2012-13, it lost all four Tests. This season too, on balance, India appears to hold the aces.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T115<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The extraordinary sight of a lake in Bengaluru on fire, with a massive plume of smoke that could be seen from afar, is a warning sign that urban environments are crashing under the weight of official indifference. If wetlands are the kidneys of the cities, as scientists like to describe them, Karnataka's capital city has entered a phase of chronic failure. No longer the city of lakes and famed gardens, it has lost an estimated 79% of water bodies and 80% of its tree cover from the baseline year of 1973. Successive governments in the State have ignored the rampant encroachment of lake beds and catchment areas for commercial exploitation, and the pollution caused by sewage, industrial effluents and garbage, which contributed to the blaze on Bellandur lake. The neglect is deliberate, since some of the finest urban ecologists in the city have been warning that government inaction is turning Bengaluru into an unliveable mess. It is time the State government took note of the several expert recommendations that have been made, including those of the Centre for Ecological Sciences of the Indian Institute of Science. The priority, clearly, is to end pollution outfalls into the water bodies, which will help revive them to an acceptable state of health. Identifying all surviving wetlands and demarcating them using digital and physical mapping will help communities monitor encroachments, while removal of land-grabbers and restoration of interconnecting channels is crucial to avoid future flooding events.
Loss of natural wetlands is an ongoing catastrophe in India. A decade ago, when the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History released a conservation atlas for all States using space applications, it reported the tragic fact that 38% of wetlands had already been lost nationally; and shockingly, in some districts only 12% survived. The Centre has since issued rules for conservation and management, and chosen 115 water bodies in 24 States for protection support, but this is obviously too little. Moreover, research studies show that the concentration of heavy metals in such sites is leading to bioaccumulation, thus entering the plants and animals that ultimately form part of people's food.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T116<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Grace and poise in the face of imminent defeat is a rare political virtue. Even so, the behaviour of the MLAs of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam during the confidence vote moved by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the Tamil Nadu Assembly marks an abysmal low. When it became clear that Mr. Palaniswami would carry the confidence vote, DMK members resorted to violence to stall the proceedings citing one excuse or another. They tore up papers, broke furniture, smashed microphones and took over the Speaker's chair. After adjourning the House to see if he could restore a measure of calm, Speaker P. Dhanapal ordered the eviction of the DMK members. Members of the Congress, an ally of the DMK, walked out in protest. Those left in their seats were only the two factions of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, one led by Chief Minister Palaniswami and the other by former Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam. Admittedly, this is hardly the ideal situation in which to hold a trust vote. However, the fact that Mr. Palaniswami won the vote 122 to 11, getting four votes more than what constitutes an absolute majority in the 234-member legislature, has lent his victory the political legitimacy he sorely needed at this juncture. True, some of the MLAs voted for the motion fearing disqualification, but this is no argument for the vote to have been conducted by secret ballot. Governor Ch. Vidyasagar Rao, after due consideration, had quite correctly not taken to the idea of a composite floor test, a course which might have given protection to members from disqualification on ground of defection. Mr. Palaniswami was sworn in on the basis of signed letters of support from AIADMK MLAs, and he did not lose time in convening the House for the motion of confidence. If there were procedural irregularities during the trust vote, these were largely on account of the actions of DMK members.
If he believes that the AIADMK members, who were confined in a beach resort by the party leadership for the better part of two weeks, need more time to make an informed choice in the confidence vote, he can move a no-confidence motion against the government after giving due notice. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T117<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Delhi court's acquittal of two persons accused of involvement in the 2005 serial blasts in the city, thereby bringing an end to their long incarceration, brings to light another instance of unconscionable miscarriage of justice in this country. Additional Sessions Judge Reetesh Singh acquitted the two men - Mohammad Hussain Fazli and Mohammad Rafiq Shah - of all charges, while saying it found no evidence to link the third accused, Tariq Ahmed Dar, to the blasts, though it convicted him for being a member of a terrorist organisation. At one level, the judgment is a reassuring affirmation of the independence at the lower rungs of the Indian judiciary. But it must invite, visibly, a response from the state to inquire into and address the processes that keep investigating agencies and prosecutors so determinedly on false trails. The frightening monotony with which Indian agencies have been failing to professionally investigate terrorism cases, and are accused of framing innocents, should jolt the system. The court said the prosecution had "miserably failed" to prove its case regarding who carried out the October 29, 2005 bomb blasts, that killed 67 and injured more than 200 people. It noted that the prosecution failed to establish a link between Dar and the other two Kashmiris accused. The explosions, in a bazaar outside the New Delhi railway station, in a bus, and in the Sarojini Nagar market, came just before Deepavali.
This is not the first time that investigation into a terror case has fallen flat in a court of law; nor is it the only instance of the Indian security agencies being accused of framing innocents. The judgment is a telling commentary on India's faulty counter-terror posture, one that demands a holistic overhaul. There is a long list of terror attacks in which the security establishment failed to carry out a scientific probe and ended up framing innocent persons. The Malegaon blast of 2006, the attack on Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad in 2007, the Samjhauta Express attack of 2007 have all seen the investigating agencies flailing to find the guilty. Such incompetence has grave implications for India's preparedness to avert terrorist strikes.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T118<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Even in the fraught and volatile framework of India-Pakistan ties, the Permanent Indus Commission mandated to implement the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) has met like clockwork, 112 times in 56 years, annually in each country. The commission has experts who look into issues and disputes on the ground over the utilisation of the waters of six rivers of the Indus system. Under the treaty, India has full use of the three "eastern" rivers (Beas, Ravi, Sutlej), while Pakistan has control over the three "western" rivers (Indus, Chenab, Jhelum), although India is given rights to use these partially as well for certain purposes. As a result, there should be little to comment in the normal course when India accepts Pakistan's invitation to the next round of talks, as it has for the Permanent Indus Commission in Lahore later this month. The move is welcome, as it denotes India's commitment to the treaty that has stood the test of time and war, and also displays New Delhi's sincerity on the issue of water-sharing, given that the IWT is seen to be a model in dispute management. In September last year, doubts had been raised over India's commitment after the terrorist attack on an army camp in Uri, killing 19 soldiers. In the days that followed, senior officials announced the suspension of talks until there was an "atmosphere free of terror" after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on the treaty to consider retaliatory measures against Pakistan for the attack, saying, "blood and water cannot go together". Mr. Modi repeated some of those angry sentiments at public rallies where he said India would not allow even a "drop of water" to go waste into Pakistan. The atmosphere was also charged after the government announced "surgical strikes" had been carried out along the Line of Control and subsequently pulled out from the SAARC summit in Pakistan, leading to fears of a freeze in bilateral ties.
In the event, the government has chosen wisely, with some encouragement from the World Bank and persistence by Pakistan, to step back from much of that rhetoric, and allow IWT commissioners from both countries to meet.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T119<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>President Donald Trump's address to the joint session of Congress was unusual insofar as he adopted a distinctly less combative tone on certain issues, and refrained from his melodramatic oratorical strategy of painting America as a nation facing a dark future in a dangerous world. Most striking in terms of the change in his tenor were his remarks on immigration. Through most of his election campaign, he frequently promised to detain and deport "illegal aliens" and build a wall along the Mexican border to keep "rapists" and drug dealers out. While the Department of Homeland Security has indeed carried out raids against undocumented immigrants in a number of major American cities over the past few weeks, Mr. Trump on Tuesday expressed his willingness to consider a merit-based system, rather than relying on lower-skilled immigrants, which could be achieved through "real and positive immigration reform". Yet Mr. Trump appeared to blunt the positive impact of this long-awaited softening in his rhetoric on immigration when he announced a proposal to create an office to serve 'Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement', apparently a special agency with a mandate to focus on tackling crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. As before, the fact that multiple studies of the demographics of crime suggest that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans has not deterred him from making such xenophobic proposals.
Mr. Trump is also likely to have been alluding to Indian fiscal policies when he spoke of a country that taxed U.S.-made Harley-Davidson motorcycles at a 100% rate. Even though subsequent reports pointed out that the sales of the motorcycle company have grown at a brisk pace of 30% over the past two years in India despite such taxation, it is Mr. Trump's penchant for flirting with the idea of introducing protectionist measures in U.S. trade policy that is causing alarm in India and elsewhere. It is hard to distinguish how much of Mr. Trump's attack on the global trade system, which he blames for taking away Americans' jobs, is bluster, and how much portends actual policy change.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T120<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Manipur will vote in 38 of its 60 Assembly constituencies on Saturday in the first of two phases. This election is shaping up into something new for Manipur's polity, a direct contest between two national parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. The Congress is seeking to defend its 15-year record in power, while the BJP fancies its chances in a State that has generally voted favourably for the party ruling at the Centre. The four-month-long blockade by the United Naga Council of highways leading up to the valley has dominated the discourse in the run-up to the elections. The Manipur elections are important for both national parties. The Congress is seeking to retain its hold as the only party that has electoral support across various ethnic and geographic regions in the State, while the BJP is keen to get power in another northeastern State, after its victory last year in Assam. A contest between the Congress and the BJP in Manipur is welcome, as both parties do not represent any specific ethnic groups, unlike other parties in the fray in previous elections. But the BJP lacks a grassroots base in Manipur and largely comprises leaders who have defected from the Congress. This has resulted in a political campaign largely made up of accusations and counter-accusations of corruption, besides the blame game on the ongoing blockade.
The decision in early December 2016 by the Okram Ibobi Singh government to notify the formation of seven new districts, creating 16 districts in the State, was momentous. It allowed the Congress to seek support from the hill areas for this decision, as the new districts in the hills made for better administrative access in areas far from the valley. However, it resulted in the intensification of the blockade sponsored by the UNC, severely hitting normal life in Manipur. The persistence of the blockade has led to some degree of disaffection owing to the inability of the Congress government to bring it to an end, even if the government's defence that any punitive measures against the UNC would have led to violence cannot be summarily dismissed. The Congress blames the Centre for not prevailing upon the UNC and other Naga groups to end the blockade, while the BJP blames the Congress for precipitating the crisis. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T121<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Recent discussions between Indian and Chinese officials on the way forward in Afghanistan are a welcome sign that both countries are attempting to put a very bad year in bilateral ties behind them, and seek common ground where possible. In Afghanistan, where both China and India see potential for investment and share concerns over the rise of radicalism and terrorism, there are many avenues for cooperation. The fact that Beijing initiated the special talks by inviting Indian officials who deal with Afghanistan and proposed a "joint development project" encourages the conclusion that China is unwilling to have its options cramped by Pakistan's reservations about India's role in Afghanistan. The Ministry of External Affairs says there was broad agreement on trade and economic ties, with Chinese officials reportedly praising India's measures to welcome investment and facilitate visas for closer business ties. On the issues that dominated the India-China narrative in 2016, particularly India's bid for Nuclear Suppliers Group membership and to have Masood Azhar designated a global terrorist at the UN, there was little movement. But a new conversation has started, and could yield results by the mid-year deadline. There is a lowering of rhetoric as well. While China is no longer trotting out its old line on opposing India's NSG membership as a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, India has stopped referring to China as the "one country" that is thwarting its ambitions.
New Delhi must prepare for the larger challenge this year that will inevitably come from China's Belt and Road Initiative (B&amp;RI, or One Belt, One Road). Through the mega infrastructure and trade project, China has plans in place to reach out to each one of India's land and maritime neighbours, most of whom have signed up for it. In May, a conference hosted by President Xi Jinping will bring all of India's neighbourhood to Beijing, with the exception of India. India has decided to not join the B&amp;RI and will not attend even as an observer as the $51-billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, now an integral part of the B&amp;RI initiative, runs through areas of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. This concerns India's territorial integrity, and New Delhi needs to find ways to make China more sensitive to its concerns. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T122<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The arrest of two suspected Islamic State associates on Sunday from Gujarat once again raises the question whether the terrorist group is finding support in India. Coincidentally, the arrests happened the same day that Hafeezudin T.K., one of the 21 persons who went missing from Kerala last year and were believed to have joined the IS, was reported to have been killed in a drone strike in Afghanistan. If these allegations and reports are correct, it would show that the IS is gaining some influence at least among a handful of youth in India. In recent months, anti-terror officials have arrested young people from different parts of the country - in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, West Bengal and Rajasthan. The IS thrives on support from foreign jihadists, largely the young. Ever since the organisation declared a 'Caliphate' in 2014, it has attracted tens of thousands of fighters from around the world. It used two tactics - urging sympathisers either to travel to Iraq or Syria, its strongholds, and join the war, or carry out terror attacks in their own countries after declaring allegiance to the 'Caliph', Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. India has remained largely insulated from this trend. The number of Indians to have joined the ranks of the IS is very small. According to a December 2015 report by the intelligence company Soufan Group, the number of Indians who have joined the IS was 23, compared to 760 from the U.K. and 150 from the U.S.
The IS's puritanical, one-size-fits-all brand of Islam hasn't found much resonance in India. Given the syncretic nature of Indian Islam, it is extremely difficult for groups such as the IS to become popular among Muslims, as it did in parts of Iraq and Syria. But lone- wolf attacks, inspired by the IS world view and tactics, could pose security risks. The IS is not recruiting people through local communities as in the case of other terror organisations or, as in Pakistan and Afghanistan, through madrasas. The IS's medium is the Internet. It reaches out through online propaganda. This is all the more significant at a time when the IS is under attack in its core territories and is desperate to expand its reach beyond West Asia.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T123<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>News of the killing of Indian national Srinivas Kuchibhotla in Kansas has shocked India, and raised fears about the safety of foreigners and immigrants in America. The term "hate crime" is writ large in the minds of the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and their anxious families back home, even as law enforcement officials piece together the tragic events at a bar in Kansas City. That prior to the attack the shooter, U.S. military veteran Adam Purinton, reportedly asked Kuchibhotla and his co-worker and fellow Indian, Alok Madasani, whether they were residing in the U.S. illegally hints at the possible motivation for the violent encounter. Eyewitness reports confirming that the killer yelled, "Get out of my country," moments before unleashing a hail of bullets on the two Indians, also injuring a white man who sought to intervene on their behalf, suggests a xenophobic racism. While this may be an isolated instance of hate crime, given the political climate in the U.S., it cannot but shine a spotlight on President Donald Trump's anti-immigrant actions. Especially after Mr. Trump's executive order banning entry into the U.S. of travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries and refugees from Syria and indefinitely putting on hold the country's refugee asylum programme - even if implementation of the order has been limited, so far.
Fear-mongering about America's weak borders allowing the unconstrained entry of "illegal aliens" into the country has a much older provenance. Throughout the bruising two-year election campaign that culminated in the November presidential election, Mr. Trump's provocative arguments about building a wall along the Mexican border and banning Muslims from entering the U.S went largely unchallenged by the Republican Party. Last week, around the same time as the attack in Kansas City, Mr. Trump tweeted about seven people shot dead in Chicago, pointing an unsubtle finger at violence in inner cities associated with African-Americans in poverty. He did not tweet on the Kansas attack. The White House was quick to dismiss as "absurd" any link between the Kansas City shooting and the rhetoric on undocumented immigrants. That may well be, but the selective social media outrage of Mr. Trump on violent acts across the U.S. is disturbing. Why, for instance, did his administration not condemn that act of violence more explicitly? </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T124<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>India's decision to allow its border roads in Mizoram and Tripura to be used by Bangladeshi forces as they construct border outposts in the inhospitable terrain of the Chittagong Hill Tracts shows just how far the two countries have come to bridging their trust deficit. The decision, conveyed last week in Dhaka during the meeting of Home Ministry and security officials working on closer border management cooperation, came as Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar flew into Bangladesh to begin preparations for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's visit to India in early April. If the visit goes as planned, it will be her first bilateral trip to India since 2010, when the MoU for the Land Boundary Agreement was originally signed. The terms of that agreement have now been fully implemented, and Ms. Hasina's visit will build on the boost that relations received from the historic agreement that was signed in 2015 during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Dhaka. Ms. Hasina has long made it clear that she would only return the visit when there are 'substantive outcomes' on the table, and the fact that officials are now speaking of a visit in two months' time indicates that several important announcements can be expected. There is speculation about a defence partnership agreement, movement on the Teesta water-sharing agreement, the Ganga water barrage project, and other energy and connectivity projects. Any of these would go a long way in cementing ties that are increasingly described as a "win-win" for both neighbours.
However, both New Delhi and Dhaka would be aware of the possible bumps in the road ahead. Some of these involve the Centre and the affected Indian States. For instance, water-sharing is a highly emotive subject, and movement on Teesta water-sharing has been held up largely because of West Bengal's reservations. To address them, the Central government needs to reach out to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee. Similarly Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has raked up the Farakka Barrage project. For Ms. Hasina, the political worries are greater. She faces an election in 2018, and with the opposition accusing her of being soft on India, she cannot be seen to be returning home empty-handed on the water question. Also, while the border issue has been resolved, border firing has not ceased, an issue Ms. Hasina's rivals use to target her. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T125<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>There could not have been a clearer mandate in the 2017 civic polls in Maharashtra. Except for Thane, where the Shiv Sena managed a comfortable victory, and Mumbai, where it squeaked ahead of the BJP by two seats, the BJP won every city corporation easily. Of the 1,268 municipal seats, the party won 628, more than tripling its 2012 tally. There could not be a better affirmation of support for the party in power at the State as well as its Chief Minister, who staked his political reputation on the polls. Besides fielding competitive candidates in places where the party had a strong base, the BJP's strategy to woo viable contestants from other parties in places where it was weak yielded strong returns. The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party were reduced to minor players in most of the corporations. In Mumbai, the Shiv Sena has, for the first time since it came to power nearly 25 years ago, seen a close competitor in the BJP; there is now a chance that the mayor could be elected from outside the Sena. While the Marathi-dominated areas of the city helped the regionalist party consolidate support, its reduced win ratio, of only 37% of the seats contested as opposed to over 50% in previous civic polls, suggests that it can no longer count Mumbai as an undisputed stronghold. The politics of regional identity and patronage may have helped the Sena become the single largest party in India's richest municipal corporation. But its reduced win ratio is a reflection of its dismal performance in ensuring civic works, with sanitation, infrastructure, public health and education in poor shape in the city.
The BJP will be content with its strong performance, which has followed civic poll victories in Chandigarh and Madhya Pradesh and in some Legislative Council elections in Uttar Pradesh. This may not reflect a popular endorsement of the demonetisation move, as its supporters argue, but at the very least it suggests that 'notebandi' is highly unlikely to hurt the BJP's prospects in the ongoing Assembly elections. It is impossible to not contrast the BJP's success with the performance of the Congress in the recent civic polls. Clearly, the BJP has become the central pole of Indian politics, a position the Congress occupied for a long time. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T126<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Heading into Assembly elections in Uttarakhand, the Bharatiya Janata Party had a clear edge after months of political turmoil in the State, that included a spell of President's Rule and the Supreme Court's intervention. Chief Minister Harish Rawat had sought to turn the elections into a referendum over the tribulations that his government was subjected to by both the BJP and its government at the Centre. At the same time, his government had struggled to defend itself against allegations of graft. In the event, the BJP managed to repeat its performance of the Lok Sabha election in 2014, when it won in all five parliamentary constituencies and led in 63 out of 70 Assembly segments. By winning 57 seats in the Assembly elections, the BJP has for the first time managed a decisive majority in a State that has traditionally returned close verdicts. By all indications, it reaped the benefit of anti-incumbency due to issues such as migration from the hills to the plains and out of Uttarakhand as well, lack of adequate employment opportunities and infrastructure, and persisting problems relating to the 2013 floods. In 2014, the BJP's pitch on "development" received significant support and it has now promised to focus on the issue. Conversely, the Congress's lament that it did not receive adequate Central support in both flood relief and reconstruction apart from developmental work in the State clearly found few takers among the voters, who simply chose the party in power at the Centre.
The Congress also made the mistake of limiting the election campaign to a personality contest centred on Mr. Rawat. Stung by the defection of many leaders to the BJP, especially from the Garhwal region, and faced with the formidable challenge of overcoming the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the party came up short. The success of the BJP must also take into account the fact that 11 of its 57 MLAs are defectors from the Congress. Despite the overwhelming majority for the party which should allow the new Chief Minister to concentrate on administrative tasks instead of constantly managing MLAs to defend narrow majorities in the House, he faces an uphill battle. Since the separation from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand saw high economic growth till around 2012-13, justifying the bifurcation.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T127<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Pakistan's decision to launch a national census, after much delay, is a welcome step that would allow it to formulate realistic policies to address the challenges it faces. The data are critical as key federal decisions such as resource allocation for provinces and delimitation of electoral constituencies are taken based on demographic numbers. This would be the first census in 19 years. The government is supposed to do it every 10 years, but Pakistani authorities, under pressure from political parties and ethnic groups, have delayed the process. The Nawaz Sharif government actually moved into action after a Supreme Court order set a March deadline to start the process. The army has provided 200,000 personnel for security for the 70-day campaign. It is not difficult to see why traditional political parties and ethnic leaders oppose the data-gathering. Since the last census was conducted in 1998 by the second Sharif government, Pakistan has undergone major changes. There has been a massive influx of people into Sindh, while the population growth in Punjab is slowing down. But political parties in Sindh say many Sindhis in rural Sindh may not be counted as they do not have national identity cards. Punjabis fear the current edge they have in Pakistan's politics on the strength of demographics may be diminished. In Balochistan, local political groups had demanded that the process be delayed till hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees are returned to Afghanistan. The refugees have been excluded from the process following a ruling by the Baloch High Court. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, tribal groups have opposed the census citing reverse migration of locals and influx of Afghan refugees.
But such challenges will always be there, given the influence of ethnic groups and provincial satraps in Pakistani politics. What is more important for Islamabad is to not give in to pressure to delay critical administrative decisions. The census is not merely an exercise of counting heads. It provides information on key indicators such as population density, gender ratio, literacy rate, financial conditions and employment numbers. As the 19-year-old census data are obsolete, it is crucial for the government to obtain an updated picture of the country's socio-economic composition to make the right policy choices.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T128<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>India's rank of 131 among 188 countries on the UNDP's Human Development Index for 2015 and its 'medium' performance pose the uncomfortable question: would not the score have been significantly better if the higher economic growth trajectory of two and a half decades of liberalisation had been accompanied by a parallel investment in people? Few will argue that the rise in incomes that came with a more open economy has not translated into a higher quality of life for many Indians and raised overall life expectancy at birth by more than 10 years from the 1990 level, to reach 68.3 years. Progress has also been made in raising awareness about issues affecting women's empowerment, such as public safety, acid attacks, discrimination in inheritance rights and lack of equal employment opportunity. Policy reforms have been instituted in some of these areas as a result. But as the HDI data show, significant inequalities persist, particularly between States and regions, which act as major barriers to improvement. The percentage of women in the workforce is the lowest in India among the BRICS countries, and the national record on the population that lives in severe multidimensional poverty is also the worst in the bloc. These are clear pointers to the lost decades for India, when universalisation of education and health care could have pulled deprived sections out of the poverty trap.
A central focus on social indicators is necessary for India to break free from its position as an underachiever. The fiscal space now available has been strengthened by steady economic growth, and more should be done to eliminate subsidies for the richest quintile - estimated by the UNDP to be $16 billion in 2014 in six consumption areas including gold and aviation fuel. The rise in revenues from all sources should go towards making public education of high standards accessible to all and delivering on the promised higher budgetary outlay for health care. Bolstered by a conscious effort to help traditionally backward regions, such policies will help eliminate the losses produced by inequalities that lower national human development indices. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T129<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The first open hearing into the alleged links between the campaign of Donald Trump and unnamed parties associated with the Russian government kicked off this week, even as the President put out a series of social media posts that seemed to mischaracterise statements coming out of that hearing. Ground-shaking revelations have come from the grilling of FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Michael Rogers by the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee. The first was from Mr. Comey, who confirmed that the FBI was investigating Russia's efforts to interfere in the presidential election, including links between specific individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Last month Mr. Trump's nominee for National Security Adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned from his post after it emerged that he had withheld information about being in contact with Russia's Ambassador in Washington prior to Mr. Trump's inauguration. This month, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the probe into alleged Russian meddling when it came to light that he had met the Ambassador prior to the election. Yet he continues to head the institution charged with the inquiry. Mr. Comey revealed that the FBI investigation began in July 2016, when evidence emerged that the Democratic National Committee had been hacked by Russia-related entities and emails handed over to WikiLeaks.
Even as the U.S. intelligence community scrambles to put together the pieces of the Trump-Moscow puzzle, it has, ironically, found itself in the crosshairs of exposure. Earlier this month WikiLeaks released a trove of confidential CIA documents , a series labelled "Vault 7", which showed the Agency's penetration of the security systems of household electronic devices that could then be used for covert surveillance. While such timed "leaks" are meant to target his political opponents, Mr. Trump's own tweets are at odds with revelations in the House hearing. In early March, he accused former President Barack Obama of ordering wiretaps on Trump Tower - yet Mr. Comey said neither the FBI nor the Department of Justice had any information to support that allegation. Mr. Rogers dismissed the White House suggestion that Mr. Obama had asked British intelligence to spy on Mr. Trump, a claim the U.K. has denied.

Of the two mobile operators, Idea functioned in its early years as a three-way joint venture involving the Tata Group, U.S. telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T, and the Aditya Birla Group. The proposed deal represents a welcome chance to resurrect its flagging fortunes. The last three quarters proved a brutal testament to the ravages that heightened competition could wreak on a middle-of-the-pack firm's operational finances. In Vodafone's case, the planned merger offers the global telecom major an opportunity to downsize its engagement with a market in which promise has outweighed performance, without actually exiting it. To that extent, it is a win-win for both parties. Set to vault the combined entity to the top of the heap in India's 1.13-billion subscribers strong mobile phone services market, the 'merger of equals', as the two companies described it, will enable Vodafone to straight away net about Rs. 3,900 crore on consummation of the deal by selling a 4.9% stake to the Aditya Birla Group, leaving its holding in the new company at 45.1%. Idea's controlling shareholders will have an opportunity to increase the 26% stake they will have at the start of the relationship by acquiring more shares from Vodafone over the next four years. The two firms expect to see substantial cost savings as the projected synergies from capital and operational expenditure help focus on meeting the challenges of a fast-evolving market amid a tariff war with the current leader Bharti Airtel and the ambitious recent entrant Reliance Jio.
Nevertheless, the merger, however grand the scale, could well end up being less than adequate to help staunch the flow of red ink amid an industrywide slide in average revenue per user and the steadily escalating cost of bidding for fresh wireless spectrum. With mobile number portability having made it easier for customers to switch networks on account of service quality levels or pricing, Vodafone and Idea have their work cut out in the lead-up to the merger, which they expect to close in 2018.

It represents an effort to unite Hindus for the 2019 general election, but it could impair the ability of the party to expand to the middle. Perhaps most importantly, can he share power and work productively with others, something he has not had to do yet. He has periodically irritated the BJP and the RSS for his go-it-alone style, a failing that makes him somewhat suspect in the view of the collegially oriented Sangh Parivar. He is a superb orator and seems committed to a mission like Mr. Modi. He is also committed to a fight against graft and corruption and goondaism, a welcome relief for a State like U.P. that has had a chequered record on this. While he has issued inflammatory statements, he seems to be free of charges of personal corruption. As a bachelor and monk, he is also free of the irritating efforts of relatives trying to benefit from access to power, a point that the party has been emphasising. He can also defer the demand (primarily from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad) to immediately construct a Ram Temple and can probably do so. After all who can challenge his Hindutva credentials? Sometimes it is necessary to keep in mind that Mahatma Gandhi was a better analyst of views of the great mass of Hindus than, for example was Veer Savarkar or even the first sarsanghchalak of the RSS K.B. Hedgewar. Mahatma Gandhi firmly believed that through his own perfection in personal behaviour he could influence the behaviour of others. Yogi Adityanath may not be committed to Gandhi's ahimsa, though I feel, Mahatma Gandhi on this was something of exception among Hindu religious activists, but the emphasis on incorruptibility is similar. Let us also not forget that Mr. Modi's original calling was to be a monk and I think there is still about him something of the monk all leading to a certain sympathy each has for the other. 
Let me first talk about comparisons between Mr. Modi and President Trump. I am always suspicious of these kinds of cross-cultural comparisons of leaders. They come from very different backgrounds. More than just cultural differences, Mr. Modi comes from a low caste poor family, while President Trump came from a rich one. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T132<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>In a setback to the Union government, the High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday set aside the order passed by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) handing over murder case of RSS worker Rudresh to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). However, the court refused to interfere in invoking the provisions of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act against four accused in the case by the city police, while allowing them to continue the probe. Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order while partly allowing the petitions filed by Asim Shariff and the other accused, who had questioned handing over the case to NIA besides challenging invoking of Sections 15,16,17,18 and 20 of UAP Act against them by the city police. The order of the central government and the documents produced before the court do not disclose that the central government has applied its mind to the facts of the case... and it is clear that without collecting any material, the Under Secretary to the central government has passed the order dated December 7, 2016, entrusting the investigation to the NIA, the court said. Pointing out that communication to MHA was by the then Commissioner of Police, Bangalore, and not by the State government, the court said there is nothing to show that the State government had supplied information or produced documents for consideration of the central government. The court also said that this shows that the contention, taken up by the central government that has based its decision on the report submitted by the State government, is false.
Even the letter written by the then Police Commissioner, the court said, only intimated the provisions under which the case was registered, and did not produce any document or evidence to show either the involvement of the petitioners or that the material collected by the investigation officer indicated the commission of the scheduled offences by the petitioners. On overall consideration of the facts and circumstances discussed, I am of the opinion that central government has failed to comply with the requirements of the Section 6(5) of the Act, the court said, while noticing that apart from the letter, there was no other material before the central government to facilitate it to form an opinion that the scheduled offence [offences under UAP Act] has been committed by the accused.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T133<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>While the Congress's leadership has said little publicly on its defeat in U.P., some of its spokespersons exhibited a thoughtfulness on television soon after when they spoke of a need to reflect deeply on the inability of the party to come up with a winning formula, so to speak. If the party ever gets down to such an exercise seriously, it need do nothing more than study Nehru's conduct as Prime Minister. And they could make no better a start than to listen to his public address at midnight on August 14, 1947. There, between the weary voice and measured cadence, members of today's Congress party would find a purpose worth reclaiming. Nehru had spoken of independence as essentially an opportunity for "end(ing of) poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity." There is clarity in this, for Nehru could see that without it Independence would amount to no more that replacing a colonial autocracy with a native one. It is interesting that while even "prosperity" makes an appearance later in the speech 'secularism' is altogether missing from it. Does this mean that Nehru was somehow lacking in commitment to it? Not even his most ardent critics would dare propose this. Or can it be said that Nehru could afford to not foreground secularism in a way that the Congress must today as the climate has changed considerably since? Hardly, Nehru was speaking even as communal violence enacted a deathly dance around him. And his subsequent actions speak not only for where he stood vis-à-vis the question of the role of religion in the nascent republic but also of the role of the government in ensuring the safety of India's Muslims post Partition. Eyewitness accounts speak of him as a man possessed haranguing roving gangs of Hindus seeking revenge on Delhi's streets in August 1947.
Some years later he was to ensure the re-codification of Hindu personal law with a view to redressing the balance against women. Petitions seeking justice in marriage that have reached the Supreme Court from Christian and Muslim women suggest that he erred in not giving the same treatment to all religions. But he had stopped with this. Unlike the Congress after Indira Gandhi, he did not allow his commitment to safeguarding the rights of India's minorities to be exchanged for any empowerment of the clergy.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T134<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The Telugu Desam Party Telangana State unit has alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi leadership was planning to take up delimitation of assembly constituencies with political considerations rather than administrative convenience. The TDP-TS charged the ruling party with taking up reorganisation of districts in violation of the constitutional norms as also the provisions under the A.P. Reorganisation Act 2014. A delegation of TDP-TS leaders led by its president L. Ramana and working president A. Revanth Reddy met Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi at New Delhi on Tuesday and lodged a complaint against the manner in which the Government went ahead with reorganisation of the districts as also the efforts to delimit the constituencies to suit its political purposes. They informed the Chief Election Commissioner that delimitation of constituencies to increase their number in both the States had been assured as part of the Reorganisation Act. The provisions of the Act, however, made it clear that status quo would be maintained when it came to the boundaries of panchayats, mandals and revenue divisions till the ECI initiates the delimitation process.
The reorganisation was effected without taking population or administrative convenience as criterion and this resulted in huge disparities in population and resources in different districts. The prime intention behind the reorganisation was to ensure that strong bases of the Opposition parties were divided and in the process, the Government was also planning to change the boundaries of the reserved constituencies. This was evident from the manner in which some tribal areas under Schedule V were merged with plains. The TDP-TS leaders wanted the EC to ensure that delimitation was done on the basis of the erstwhile 10 districts of Telangana rather than taking into account the reorganised districts. Explaining about the switching over of some members elected on behalf of the TDP to TRS, they urged the Chief Election Commissioner to take appropriate action against the defectors. Several representations were made to Legislative Assembly Speaker and even the court had asked the Speaker to initiate appropriate action into the issue, no action had been taken so far, they said.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T135<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>When the tail wags the dog, the dog risks losing control of it altogether. The national leadership of the BJP may or may not have been guided by the wishes of a vociferous section of its cadre base in nominating  Hindutva firebrand Yogi Adityanath as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. But in so doing it has ceded considerable power to a faction within its organisational structure that is both fiercely autonomous and frequently defiant. After politically exploiting his divisive rhetoric, and allowing him to share State-level campaign space with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP would have found it difficult to refuse Mr. Adityanath a prominent role in post-election U.P. But to make him the Chief Minister is to risk the fringe taking hold of the centre. In doing so, the BJP has willy nilly shifted the discourse from development, which Mr. Modi often projected in the election campaign. Indeed, his choice is bound to signal in the public mind a front-staging of issues such as cow protection, love 'jihad', and forced religious conversion, all of which assume a character of aggressive minority baiting. As the head of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organisation implicated in several cases of rioting, the new Chief Minister does not exactly inspire confidence about law and order, an area of major failing for the Samajwadi Party government that was voted out. Indeed, his assuming office sends all the wrong signals to the law enforcement machinery of the State. When the BJP projected only Mr. Modi during the campaign and went into the election without a chief ministerial candidate, it was taking care not to upset the different streams within its support base. But the tact and sense that was evident at that stage seems to have been lost in the messy triumphalism after the victory.
By opting for two Deputy Chief Ministers, Keshav Prasad Maurya, the party's State president who is from the backward classes, and Dinesh Sharma, the Mayor of Lucknow who is a Brahmin, the BJP is perhaps hoping to not only get the caste representation right in the Cabinet but also rein in Mr. Adityanath. But going by experience, a person of Mr. Adityanath's standing and persuasion is unlikely to let himself be outflanked in government.

It includes multiple amendments proposed by the government that did not figure in Arun Jaitley's speech of February 1, either in letter or in spirit. For instance, while the speech devoted 420 words to proposed measures to improve transparency in electoral funding, amendments have been made to the Companies Act of 2013 that actually turn the clock back on existing disclosure standards. Till now, companies could only contribute up to 7.5% of their average net profits in the past three financial years to political parties. They were required to disclose in their profit and loss accounts the amount of contributions and the names of political parties to which they were made. The ceiling has now been dropped, paving the way for a firm to deploy unlimited capital into political coffers irrespective of its own financial and operational health. Companies would still have to reveal the extent of their financing of parties, but no longer have to name their preferred parties. For the sake of argument, one could say the 7.5% limit was arbitrary and restricted willing and able corporate donors' ability to influence political activity. But doing away with the limit makes firms susceptible to funding 'requests' from local, regional or national political formations while taking away excuses - such as it being a loss-making unit, or breaching the funding cap. 
This would open up new opportunities in crony capitalism. Pressure could be exerted on a company awaiting government clearances, or a loan restructuring from public or cooperative sector financiers. Even a publicly listed company can set up subsidiaries just to fund parties. This removes any pretence of transparency in the process as the donor will not have to disclose who he paid; the recipient has no such obligation either. It is not surprising that India Inc. has remained stoically silent so far. This abandonment of the 7.5% requisite comes in tandem with the proposal to float electoral bonds to give anonymity to political donors. The scheme for such 'bearer' bonds is still being worked out with the central bank, but how this will meet the objective of transparency isn't clear yet. </div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T137<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Two top Senators have urged the Trump administration to push for the sale of F-16 fighter jets to India to build its capability to counter security threats and balance China's growing military power in the Pacific. Senators Mark Warner from Virginia and John Cornyn from Texa in a joint letter to US Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said, the Trump administration must make the fighter jet acquisition a priority during initial bilateral discussions with India. India has launched an effort to expand its combat aircraft fleet and the competition has reportedly narrowed down to Lockheed's F-16 and Saab's Gripen. Noting that the last F-16 for the US Air Force rolled off the production line in Fort Worth in 1999, the two Senators said India remains the only major F-16 prospect customer. "A primary factor in India's decision will be compliance with Prime Minister Modi's 'Make in India' initiative, which will require establishing some level of local production capacity," Mr. Warner and Mr. Cornyn wrote. "Given the strategic significance of India selecting a US aircraft as the mainstay for its future Air Force and the potential for a decision this year, we ask that the administration make the fighter acquisition a priority during initial bilateral discussions," they said.
Mr. Warner, who is a Democrat and Mr. Cornyn from the Republican Party are the co-chairs of the influential Senate India caucus, the only country specific caucus in the US Senate. "We urge you to weigh in forcefully with the White House on the strategic significance of this deal, both to America's defence industrial base and to our growing security partnership with India," said the letter dated March 23. Making a strong case for the sale of F-16s to India, the two Senators said this would represent a historic win for America that will deepen the U.S.-India strategic defence relationship and cement cooperation between our two countries for decades to come. "It would increase interoperability with a key partner and dominant power in South Asia, build India's capability to counter threat from the north, and balance China's growing military capability in the Pacific," they said.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T138<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The first Test in Dunedin ended in a draw with the entire final day washed out. South Africa were 123 for four in the third test against New Zealand at Seddon Park in Hamilton on Saturday before rain forced the abandonment of the first day's play after 41 overs. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, who won the toss and chose to bat after overnight rain delayed the start of play by 30 minutes, was on 33 and Temba Bavuma on 13 when the decision to end play was made. The hosts had dismissed Hashim Amla for 50 after lunch just before the rain returned and forced the players off the field at about 3.20 p.m. midway through the middle session. While the rain had stopped, umpires Rod Tucker and Bruce Oxenford abandoned play shortly after 5.45 p.m. after they inspected the wicket and outfield. New Zealand had reduced South Africa to 71 for three at lunch, which was taken five minutes early when a rain shower swept across the ground. Matt Henry, who was brought back for the injured Tim Southee, dismissed debutant opener Theunis du Bruyn for a duck and had JP Duminy caught in the deep about 20 minutes before lunch.
Colin de Grandhomme had the first session's other wicket when he bowled Dean Elgar for five as the hosts, who were also without Trent Boult, reduced the Proteas to 5-2 in the fourth over. Amla was the only other wicket to fall when he played around a de Grandhomme yorker shortly after he had reached his 32nd test half century. Rain is forecast for the Hamilton area throughout the test, which New Zealand must win to level the series after South Africa won the second game in Wellington by eight wickets. 
The first Test in Dunedin ended in a draw with the entire final day washed out. In the crucial encounter at Dharamsala against Australia, the Indian team management has given the Test cap to 22-year-old Kuldeep Yadav. He is a slow left-arm chinaman bowler and also a left-hand batsman. Kuldeep Yadav's excellent performances in first-class earned him the place in the Test squad against the Australians. While everyone expected Shreyas Iyer to replace Virat Kohli, the team management made a surprise move by bringing in Kuldeep Yadav.

Questions over the readiness of the government and the RBI to handle the challenges post the high-value currency demonetization have been arising from several quarters, including the parliamentary panels, although the government has not, so far, given the details of the planning that went behind the decision. The RTI response hints while the government could have been contemplating the move for some time, the final decision came at a short notice. The official position of the RBI is that its board had recommended the demonetization move in a meeting held in New Delhi a couple of hours before the announcement. Incidentally, in a notification on May 5, 2016, the RBI introduced an incentive scheme for the banks to encourage installation of ATMs dispensing lower-denomination notes (not bigger than Rs 100). The RBI promised to reimburse 50 per cent of the actual cost of the machine or Rs 200,000 (whichever is lower) for each such installation in urban areas. In rural areas, the amount was 60 per cent or Rs 2,50,000. However, the scheme had few takers, which prompted the RBI to come out with another notification on November 2, just six days before the note ban. The directive had wanted banks to recalibrate 10 per cent of their ATM networks to dispense only Rs 100 notes and that, too, within a period of 15 days. The directives also point to the last-minute attempts made by the government to ease the problems that were anticipated after the demonetization announcement. 

In a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha in February 2017, Arjun Ram Meghwal, Minister of State, Ministry of Finance, stated that the matter to demonetize currency was under discussion (in consultation with the RBI) for several months preceding November 8, 2016.  He explained that the government, in a letter dated November 7, 2016, requested the RBI to consider cancellation of legal tender character of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination with the objective to eliminate black money and to curb the infusion and circulation of fake Indian currency notes (FICN). The central board of the RBI, in its meeting the next day, deliberated the proposal in detail and recommended withdrawal of the legal tender status of such notes, he pointed out.  The reply also specified that the currency returned to the RBI as on December 10, 2016, amounted to Rs 12.44 lakh crore although the actual amount returned would be known only after the data is reconciled with the physical cash balances to eliminate counterfeit notes, accounting errors, possible double counts and so on. That process is yet to be completed.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T140<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Child marriage is still widespread in India, which is home to a third of the world’s child brides. About half of Indian women were married before they turned 18. Child marriage is a violation of child rights, and has a negative impact on physical growth, health, mental and emotional development, and education opportunities. It also affects society as a whole since child marriage reinforces a cycle of poverty and perpetuates gender discrimination, illiteracy and malnutrition as well as high infant and maternal mortality rates. Child marriage impacts on almost all facets of reaching the Millennium Development Goals. It is for this reason that combating the problem is a key feature of the post-2015 MDG agenda and a major priority for UNICEF in India. Both girls and boys are affected by child marriage, but girls are affected in much larger numbers and with greater intensity. Child marriage can be seen across the country but it is far higher in rural than in urban areas. Girls from poorer families, scheduled castes and tribes, and with lower education levels are more likely to marry at a younger age. Although child marriage is declining, the rate of decline is slow. Broad, multi-faceted strategies are needed to target different aspects of the problem, including deep-rooted social norms and behaviours, the perceived low value of girls, limited access to education, exposure to violence, restricted freedom of movement and economic vulnerability. UNICEF has been working tirelessly to prevent child marriage across the states where it works. 

There are many causes of child marriage in India and multiple barriers to its elimination. Poverty, weak enforcement of laws, patriarchal social norms intended to ensure family honour are significant factors that increase the risk of girl being married off while still a child. Also, girls from poor households are more likely to marry as children, since marriage becomes a solution to reduce the size of the family. The cost of marriage plays a big role in families sliding further into poverty, and these high costs contribute to girls being forced to marry when other ceremonies are taking place in the family or when older siblings are being married. The national Ministry of Women and Child Development, as the nodal agency for women and children, has developed a convergent national strategy and is currently drafting a plan of action on child marriage to guide all states in the implementation of strategies to prevent the problem.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T141<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Globally, women have fewer opportunities for economic participation than men, less access to basic and higher education, greater health and safety risks, and less political representation. Guaranteeing the rights of women and giving them opportunities to reach their full potential is critical not only for attaining gender equality, but also for meeting a wide range of international development goals. Empowered women and girls contribute to the health and productivity of their families, communities, and countries, creating a ripple effect that benefits everyone. The word gender describes the socially-constructed roles and responsibilities that societies consider appropriate for men and women. Gender equality means that men and women have equal power and equal opportunities for financial independence, education, and personal development. Women's empowerment is a critical aspect of achieving gender equality. It includes increasing a woman's sense of self-worth, her decision-making power, her access to opportunities and resources, her power and control over her own life inside and outside the home, and her ability to effect change. Yet gender issues are not focused on women alone, but on the relationship between men and women in society. The actions and attitudes of men and boys play an essential role in achieving gender equality. Education is a key area of focus. Although the world is making progress in achieving gender parity in education, girls still make up a higher percentage of out-of-school children than boys.  Approximately one quarter of girls in the developing world do not attend school. Typically, families with limited means who cannot afford costs such as school fees, uniforms, and supplies for all of their children will prioritize education for their sons. Families may also rely on girls' labor for household chores, carrying water, and childcare, leaving limited time for schooling. But prioritizing girls' education provides perhaps the single highest return on investment in the developing world.  
 	An educated girl is more likely to postpone marriage, raise a smaller family, have healthier children, and send her own children to school. She has more opportunities to earn an income and to participate in political processes, and she is less likely to become infected with HIV. Women's health and safety is another important area. HIV/AIDS is becoming an increasingly impactful issue for women. This can be related to women having fewer opportunities for health education, unequal power in sexual partnership, or as a result of gender-based violence.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T142<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Social networking is the practice of expanding the number of one's business and/or social contacts by making connections through individuals, often through social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+. Based on the six degrees of separation concept (the idea that any two people on the planet could make contact through a chain of no more than five intermediaries), social networking establishes interconnected online communities (sometimes known as social graphs) that help people make contacts that would be good for them to know, but that they would be unlikely to have met otherwise. Depending on the social media platform, members may be able to contact any other member. In other cases, members can contact anyone they have a connection to, and subsequently anyone that contact has a connection to, and so on. Some services require members to have a preexisting connection to contact other members. In addition to social media platforms, the capacity for social interaction and collaboration is increasingly built into business applications. Social Networks is an interdisciplinary and international quarterly. It provides a common forum for representatives of anthropology, sociology, history, social psychology, political science, human geography, biology, economics, communications science and other disciplines who share an interest in the study of the empirical structure of social relations and associations that may be expressed in network form. It publishes both theoretical and substantive papers. Critical reviews of major theoretical or methodological approaches using the notion of networks in the analysis of social behaviour are also included, as are reviews of recent books dealing with social networks and social structure.
The editorial criteria for acceptance will be based on the degree to which a paper makes a broad theoretical or methodological, and empirically relevant, contribution to the study of social networks. Acceptable papers may range from abstract, formal mathematical derivations to concrete, descriptive case studies of particular social networks. The editors are therefore particularly interested in papers that attempt to uncover the processes by which social networks emerge, evolve and have consequences for other aspects of behaviour. However, for reports of empirical research results, manuscripts must contain the following: a discussion of sampling, representation, and general ability; a substantive foundation based on the social network literature; a consideration of social network processes; and feature meaningful data.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T143<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Poverty is associated with the undermining of a range of key human attributes, including health. The poor are exposed to greater personal and environmental health risks, are less well nourished, have less information and are less able to access health care; they thus have a higher risk of illness and disability. Conversely, illness can reduce household savings, lower learning ability, reduce productivity, and lead to a diminished quality of life, thereby perpetuating or even increasing poverty. Poverty is about not having enough money to meet basic needs including food, clothing and shelter.  However, poverty is more, much more than just not having enough money. In addition to a lack of money, poverty is about not being able to participate in recreational activities; not being able to send children on a day trip with their schoolmates or to a birthday party; not being able to pay for medications for an illness.  These are all costs of being poor. Those people who are barely able to pay for food and shelter simply can’t consider these other expenses.  When people are excluded within a society, when they are not well educated and when they have a higher incidence of illness, there are negative consequences for society.  We all pay the price for poverty.  The increased cost on the health system, the justice system and other systems that provide supports to those living in poverty has an impact on our economy. While much progress has been made in measuring and analyzing poverty, the World Bank Organization is doing more work to identify indicators for the other dimensions of poverty.  This work includes identifying social indicators to track education, health, access to services, vulnerability, and social exclusion. 
There is no one cause of poverty, and the results of it are different in every case. Poverty varies considerably depending on the situation. Feeling poor in Canada is different from living in poverty in Russia or Zimbabwe.  The differences between rich and poor within the borders of a country can also be great. Despite the many definitions, one thing is certain; poverty is a complex societal issue. No matter how poverty is defined, it can be agreed that it is an issue that requires everyone’s attention.  It is important that all members of our society work together to provide the opportunities for all our members to reach their full potential. It helps all of us to help one another.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T144<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>In ancient times, India had the Gurukula system of education in which anyone who wished to study went to a teacher's (Guru) house and requested to be taught. If accepted as a student by the guru, he would then stay at the guru's place and help in all activities at home. This not only created a strong tie between the teacher and the student, but also taught the student everything about running a house. The guru taught everything the child wanted to learn, from Sanskrit to the Holy Scriptures and from Mathematics to Metaphysics. The student stayed as long as she wished or until the guru felt that he had taught everything he could teach. All learning was closely linked to nature and to life, and not confined to memorizing some information. The modern school system was brought to India, including the English language, originally by Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay in the 1830s. The curriculum was confined to “modern” subjects such as science and mathematics, and subjects like metaphysics and philosophy were considered unnecessary. Teaching was confined to classrooms and the link with nature was broken, as also the close relationship between the teacher and the student. The Uttar Pradesh (a state in India) Board of High School and Intermediate Education was the first Board set up in India in the year 1921 with jurisdiction over Rajputana, Central India and Gwalior. In 1929, the Board of High School and Intermediate Education, Rajputana, was established. Later, boards were established in some of the states. But eventually, in 1952, the constitution of the board was amended and it was renamed Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). All schools in Delhi and some other regions came under the Board. It was the function of the Board to decide on things like curriculum, textbooks and examination system for all schools affiliated to it. 
Universal and compulsory education for all children in the age group of 6-14 was a cherished dream of the new government of the Republic of India. This is evident from the fact that it is incorporated as a directive policy in article 45 of the constitution. But this objective remains far away even more than half a century later. However, in the recent past, the government appears to have taken a serious note of this lapse and has made primary education a Fundamental Right of every Indian citizen. The pressures of economic growth and the acute scarcity of skilled and trained manpower must certainly have played a role to make the government take such a step.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T145<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Human population has been growing continuously since the end of the Black Death, around the year 1350, although the most significant increase has been in the last 50 years, mainly due to medical advancements and increase in agricultural productivity. The rate of population growth has been declining since the 1980s. The United Nations has expressed concern on continued population growth in sub-Saharan Africa. As of March 29, 2017 the world's human population is estimated to be 7.494 billion by the United States Census Bureau, and over 7 billion by the United Nations. Most contemporary estimates for the carrying capacity of the Earth under existing conditions are between 4 billion and 16 billion. Depending on which estimate is used, human overpopulation may or may not have already occurred. Nevertheless, the rapid recent increase in human population is causing some concern. The population is expected to reach between 8 and 10.5 billion between the years 2040 and 2050. In May 2011, the United Nations increased the medium variant projections to 9.3 billion for 2050 and 10.1 billion for 2100.
The recent rapid increase in human population over the past three centuries has raised concerns that the planet may not be able to sustain present or future numbers of inhabitants. The InterAcademy Panel Statement on Population Growth, circa 1994, stated that many environmental problems, such as rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, global warming, and pollution, are aggravated by the population expansion. Other problems associated with overpopulation include the increased demand for resources such as fresh water and food, starvation and malnutrition, consumption of natural resources (such as fossil fuels) faster than the rate of regeneration, and a deterioration in living conditions. Wealthy but highly populated territories like Britain rely on food imports from overseas. This was severely felt during the World Wars when, despite food efficiency initiatives like "dig for victory" and food rationing, Britain needed to fight to secure import routes. However, many believe that waste and over-consumption, especially by wealthy nations, is putting more strain on the environment than overpopulation.
Most countries have no direct policy of limiting their birth rates, but the rates have still fallen due to education about family planning and increasing access to birth control and contraception. Only China had imposed legal restrictions on having more than one child.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T146<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>India moved a step closer towards becoming a cashless economy with the launch of Unified Payment Interface (UPI). With this new payment method, your smart phone will soon double up as virtual debit cards and you’ll be able to send or receive money instantly. Along with Bharat QR code, it can help you get rid of your wallet all together. “For a number of years, we have been saying we need a revolution in banking in India. I think we can confidently say the revolution is upon us. What we have in India is the most sophisticated public payments infrastructure in the world,” Rajan said at the launch of the UPI.
Ever since it’s launched in Jan 2016, we regularly get questions like what is UPI, How does UPI work, How would it change the way I handle payments in business, etc. The Unified Payment Interface (UPI) can be thought of like an email ID for your money. It will be an unique identifier that your bank uses to transfer money and make payments using the IMPS (Immediate Payments Service). IMPS is faster than NEFT and lets you transfer money immediately and unlike NEFT, it works 24×7. This means that the online payments will become much easier without requiring a digital wallet or credit or debit card. Unified Payment Interface is an initiative by National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI), set up with the support of the Reserve Bank of India and Indian Banks Association (IBA).  The NCPI operates the Rupay payments infrastructure that – like Visa and MasterCard – allows different banks to interconnect and transfer funds.
IMPS (Immediate Payments Service) is also an initiative of NCPI. UPI is the advanced version of IMPS. Currently, if you want to make a bank payment online; you have to enter their account number, account type, Bank name and IFSC code. Even if you have all these details, typing it all in, particularly on a phone, is a painful process. Most banks take upto 12 hours to add a new payee and only then you can make the transfer. The idea behind the UPI is to do away with all of this. The interface will allow account holders across banks to send and receive money from their smart phones using just their Aadhaar unique identity number, mobile phone number or virtual payments address without entering bank account details. According to NPCI, so far only 29 banks have agreed to start this service. If your bank is UPI-enabled, you can ask it to connect you to the system. To initiate a transaction, you can use two types of address—global or local. Global address includes your mobile, Aadhaar and bank account numbers.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T147<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>General Motors' upcoming subcompact sedan, the Chevrolet Essentia has been spotted testing in India again. This time the car was seen in Mumbai draped heavily in camouflage but it did seem to sport several production ready parts. In fact compared to the test mule which was spotted early this month, this particular test mule was seen with new alloy wheels, LED taillamp and more. The car will be launched in India later this year, after the arrival of the new-generation Chevrolet Beat, which was recently spotted testing in near production guise without any camouflage. As we have told you in our earlier reports, the Chevrolet Essentia will be an all-new product based on the carmaker's popular hatchback Beat. We first saw the car in India last year at the 2016 Auto Expo in Delhi in its concept guise. Once it goes on sale in India, the car will compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire, Honda Amaze, Tata Zest, and Ford Aspire. The Chevrolet Essentia test mule was seen with alloy wheels and other production ready parts.
As for the car itself, even though we only have the rear view of the car in these images, based on the fact that this is the first test mule of the Essentia to be seen with alloys indicates that it could be a top-of-the-line variant. The car also appears to get new ORVMs compared to other test mules seen before, which also comes with integrated LED turn single lights. Now the Beat that we spotted testing recently was seen sporting a touch screen infotainment system and a new steering with mounted controls, so we can expect to see those features on the Essentia as well.
The new Chevrolet Essentia will borrow its engines from the Beat hatchback so we'll have a 1.2-litre petrol motor that will produce 77 bhp and 107 Nm of peak torque, along with a 1.0-litre diesel engine producing 56 bhp and 143 Nm. Both the engines will have a 5-speed gearbox and an automatic unit could be on offer as well. The new Chevrolet Essentia will be launched after the new-generation beat. The Essentia spotted this time was seen with production ready parts. It will rival the likes of Maruti Swift Dzire, Tata Zest and Ford Aspire. After laying low for more than a year, Chevrolet well finally launch two new products in India this year - the new-generation Chevrolet Beat and the all-new Chevrolet Essentia subcompact sedan. We saw the concept models of both the cars at the 2016 Auto Expo and the latter was recently spotted testing in India again.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T148<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>The Home Ministry believes there has been 'unprecedented improvement in Left Wing Extremism (LWE) (Home Ministry's term for Maoist violence) scenario across the country' with 'an overall 7 per cent reduction in violent incidents (1136 to 1048) and 30 per cent reduction (397 to 278) in LWE related deaths since the end of 2013'. From 2014 the forces have faced an increasing barrage of IEDs from the Maoist insurgents. Year-wise increase in the recoveries, number of blasts and the growing expertise of the insurgents in concealing them reveals IEDs are the weapon of choice for Maoists. Between January 1, 2014 and March 27, 2017 the CRPF has faced 121 blasts and has recovered 2534 IEDs across the affected states. The CRPF also lost 59 personnel to Maoist IEDs and had 169 injured as a result. The report further states, "The Ministry was trying to work with local manufacturers for bullet-proofing the vehicles. The Joint Secretary further added that the private sector in India was not producing any mine protected vehicles with the level of protection required'. The Home Ministry was in the process of providing 300 light bullet proof vehicles within the next six months. For this response, the Home Ministry received a rap on its knuckles.
One of the members pointed out, 'while bullet-proof vehicles were useful in J&amp;K however, they may not be able to protect personnel in LWE affected areas in Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand where hundreds of paramilitary and police personnel were getting killed because of mines and ambushes. He also stated that not sanctioning funds for such necessary equipment is grave negligence'.
In its conclusion, the report states, "The Committee is constrained to observe that lack of financial resources is becoming a reason for casualty of valuable lives of police and CAPF personnel which are being lost in the battle against Left Wing Extremism. The Committee feels that bullet-proof vehicles would not be safe or sufficient for use in LWE areas. On the other hand, the Ministry feels constrained to procure advanced equipment due to lack of financial resources. In such a scenario, the Committee recommends that the Government should explore the opportunities created by the Make In India programme and develop indigenous vehicles. The Committee also recommends that in the meanwhile, the Ministry should explore other measures including import of suitable vehicles".   The said committee is chaired by former Home Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram and has a total of 31 members including ten from Rajya Sabha and the 21 from Lok Sabha.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T149<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>How India Quietly Pulled Up Amazon For Selling Tricolour Doormats. India asked US, Canadian embassies to take up the matter with Amazon. Much is at stake for Amazon that plans to invest over $5 billion in India. Amazon has now made Indian laws governing use of national flag, emblems. India's reaction to an Amazon.com website selling doormats resembling the country's flag involved an unprecedented public and private offensive against the US company by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's  government, a document shows. Foreign minister Sushma Swaraj publicly threatened in January to rescind visas of Amazon employees if the doormats were not removed from its Canadian website. But a document seen by Reuters shows the government went even further in private, asking its US and Canadian embassies to raise the matter "strongly" with Amazon's senior leadership.
India also escalated the matter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and prompted a global audit by the company to "ensure that such products are not listed on any of its other" websites around the world, according to the document. Amazon, which removed the products within 24 hours and apologized to the government, declined to comment. Much is at stake for Amazon in India, where it plans to invest more than $5 billion as it takes on home-grown Flipkart and Snapdeal for a bigger share of the internet services market in the world's fastest growing major economy. Amazon has now made Indian laws that govern the use of the national flag and other emblems "an integral part of the global compliance process," the document said, outlining the steps Amazon and India have taken since the incident.
India's reaction underscores the risks governments run by nationalist leaders are posing for businesses around the world. US President Donald Trump, for example, has also taken an aggressive stance on Twitter against individual companies. Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi presented a global leadership award to Bezos at a US-India Business Council summit in Washington. Amazon told the government that it had strengthened its in-house compliance units that monitor products sold by third-party vendors on its websites, the document said. "Amazon India has conveyed that it is fully committed to respecting Indian laws and customs," the document said.</div><div class="row passage"><div style="background-color:#00BFA5;color:white">T150<span style="float:right;">Start Typing</span></div>Lok Sabha rejects amendments proposed by opposition in Rajya Sabha. Opposition has accused government of undermining Rajya Sabha. Government amending 40 laws through the Finance Bill: Opposition. The Finance Bill 2017 has been approved by Parliament, with the Lok Sabha today rejecting five amendments that were proposed by opposition parties and adopted yesterday by the Rajya Sabha, where the government is in a minority. It was a matter of embarrassment, not worry for the government as the opposition flexed its numerical muscle in the upper house. Because the Finance Bill is a "money bill" the government just needed to bring the Rajya Sabha's proposal back to the Lok Sabha, where it has a big majority, and ensure they were voted down. Three amendments were proposed by the Congress' Digvijaya Singh and two by Left leader Sitaram Yechury. The opposition has accused the government of undermining the Rajya Sabha by presenting key legislation as "Money Bills" to exclude the upper house from having a say in legislation. Money Bills once cleared by the Lok Sabha are sent to the Rajya Sabha like all other bills, but any changes that the upper house proposes are not binding. The Lok Sabha can accept or reject them. Four GST or Goods and Services Tax-related bills passed by the Lok Sabha yesterday were also presented as "Money Bills." In the debate that preceded the vote, the Congress' M Veerappa Moily called it "the biggest assault on democracy" and asked, "What is the point of having the council of states." He said all members of the Rajya Sabha should resign "if they have some pride left."
Opposition parties have alleged that the government has pushed "draconian" laws by including them in the Finance Bill. The Congress' Deependra Hooda said in the Lok Sabha today that the government was amending 40 laws through the Finance Bill, making the Rajya Sabha "incidental". "The procedures of House are being violated and the Finance Bill is being made a compendium... Just because they (the government) have a majority in the House, they should not run roughshod," said Saugata Roy of the Trinamool Congress. The amendments sought by the opposition and rejected today proposed to delete provisions that give more powers to taxmen. The Rajya Sabha also approved a cap of 7.5 per cent of net profit of the last three financial years for donations by companies to political parties and a provision to disclose the name of political parties to which a company has made contributions.</div></div>

							<td id="a" style="display: table-cell;">The Telugu Desam Party Telangana State unit has alleged that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi leadership was planning to take up delimitation of assembly constituencies with political considerations rather than administrative convenience. The TDP-TS charged the ruling party with taking up reorganisation of districts in violation of the constitutional norms as also the provisions under the A.P. Reorganisation Act 2014. A delegation of TDP-TS leaders led by its president L. Ramana and working president A. Revanth Reddy met Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi at New Delhi on Tuesday and lodged a complaint against the manner in which the Government went ahead with reorganisation of the districts as also the efforts to delimit the constituencies to suit its political purposes. They informed the Chief Election Commissioner that delimitation of constituencies to increase their number in both the States had been assured as part of the Reorganisation Act. The provisions of the Act, however, made it clear that status quo would be maintained when it came to the boundaries of panchayats, mandals and revenue divisions till the ECI initiates the delimitation process.
The reorganisation was effected without taking population or administrative convenience as criterion and this resulted in huge disparities in population and resources in different districts. The prime intention behind the reorganisation was to ensure that strong bases of the Opposition parties were divided and in the process, the Government was also planning to change the boundaries of the reserved constituencies. This was evident from the manner in which some tribal areas under Schedule V were merged with plains. The TDP-TS leaders wanted the EC to ensure that delimitation was done on the basis of the erstwhile 10 districts of Telangana rather than taking into account the reorganised districts. Explaining about the switching over of some members elected on behalf of the TDP to TRS, they urged the Chief Election Commissioner to take appropriate action against the defectors. Several representations were made to Legislative Assembly Speaker and even the court had asked the Speaker to initiate appropriate action into the issue, no action had been taken so far, they said.</td>

Panneerselvam to do what he himself may have regarded as unthinkable: revolt against the AIADMK leadership. A die-hard loyalist of Jayalalithaa, and by extension of his one-time benefactor Ms. Sasikala, Mr. Panneerselvam, who was perceived as the archetypal feudal supplicant, chose his moment to strike back at the patricians in the party. After years of bowing before Jayalalithaa, and doing as he was told unquestioningly, the three-time stand-in Chief Minister wanted, entirely legitimately, more leeway under Ms. Sasikala. Clearly, he realised after Jayalalithaa's death, that he would have to put up with another round of slavish obeisance. But it was when he sensed the public mood turning against Ms. Sasikala that he found the courage and the strength to protest. In invoking Jayalalithaa's name to justify his revolt, Mr. Panneerselvam is trying to project that it is he who is her chosen political heir. It is difficult to say how successful he will be in inheriting this mantle, but the political damage he has done to Ms. Sasikala is considerable. Not many AIADMK MLAs may have joined his revolt, but it has touched a chord with the rank and file, something she will have to contend with. On the defensive as she awaits a Supreme Court judgment in the disproportionate assets case, the long-standing friend of Jayalalithaa appears vulnerable both legally and politically. Clearly, the cloak of invincibility that Jayalalithaa seemed to have on her during even the most testing times was not Ms. Sasikala's to wear.
What Mr. Panneerselvam demonstrated to the AIADMK cadre was that there was nothing to recommend Ms. Sasikala other than her proximity to Jayalalithaa; in this she was only marginally better placed than Deepa Jayakumar, Jayalalithaa's niece, who is also making a bid to inherit the political legacy without ever having any kind of association with politics.</del><ins>publicj</ins></pre></td>
